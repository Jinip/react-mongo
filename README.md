# React Mongo

ERMAHGERD MERN!!!

This is a basic CRUD application in the MERN Stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

I tried to find resources most directly transferrable from my V School training which focused on the MEAN stack (Angular rather than React) built a Bootstrap UI and Mongoose for data integration.

To that end, this is a React app with a React-Bootstrap UI framework on an Express server utilizing Mongoose to integreate with MongoDB

This design is/will be demonstrated across other stacks which can be found on my main GitHub page
